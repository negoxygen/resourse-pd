## Getting Started with Hacktoberfest

Hacktoberfest is a month-long celebration of open source, organised by Digital Ocean.

These two resources have everything you need to learn about open-source, with a step-by-step guide to making your very first PR. Once you've got your feet wet, you're ready to come back and dive into Hacktoberfest fun!

## Rules

- Do not Dublicate the resources and link. 
- Please make sure the resources is linked with respected title.
- That's it, have fun and make something unique and creative!

## How to contribute

1. First up you need to fork (make a copy) of this repo to your Github account.

2. Clone (download) your fork to your computer

3. Set your streams so you can sync your clone with the original repo (get the latest updates)

   - `git remote add upstream https://github.com/negoxygen/resourse-pd.git`
   - `git pull upstream master`
   - The above 2 commands will synchronize your forked version of the project with the actual repository.

4. Create a branch

5. Add resouse in the resource md.

6.  Pull from the upstream again, like we did in step 3. This is to ensure we still have the latest code.

    - `git pull upstream master`

7.  Commit and push the code to your fork

8.  Create a pull request to have the changes merged from your fork into the origin
